# Product-list

App is fetching data from json -> /product-list.json

As I was not expected to not add delete or create functionalities, but for my curiosity I was add ONLY add/remove image. I know that was not the setting of this task, but I was curious the challenge for my little additional task. I hope it will be not taken as a defect, but rather a bonus. And because it was succeded so I decided to keep the code with to have history in code how to play with different source of images.

Important note is that, I enhance the json data to data which should be in real production app. I add the id for each item, and then as a consequence I allowed the name to be editable.

I was thinking about aproach you expecting about displaying photos, especialy when the url is broken. I decided to use fallback and placeholder for it to have the view more user friendly.

Finally I was avoiding additional libraries to have native approach which is light more reliable.
